#### Practice and count your breathings, reduce stress, alleviate anxiety.

- Presente is a very simple app (just one screen!) to practice breathing exercises and bring you back to the present moment.
- Presente is whatever you make of it - it's versatile and available 24/7, whenever you need it: just open the app and you'll be in your safe space.a
- Presente wants to be the #1 choice for people who feel easily overwhelmed with emotions or thoughts, stress or anxiety, and that need a "break" from daily life.
- Presente can also be used as a healthy habit of reconnecting with yourself throughout the day, to enjoy the present in a self-care and self-awareness ritual.

#### This is my first project using Flutter and Github. I'm sharing how I built it in my blog: https://youngdel.fi/la-historia-de-presente/
